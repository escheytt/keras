Appreciate any help that can be offered.  Tensorflow model has been executed with 21 columns; learning and testing.  Happy with results.
When try to use model.predict an error is created.  My code is at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ptKORsgeIA1Lmur4Vbg8f0yHQyuapVX8
I used first item/row from training set for model.predict attempt.  Lines of code associate with the model.predict are as follows: 
  single_horse = df.drop('hrse_tmfnc',axis=1).iloc[0]
  single_horse = scaler.transform(single_horse.values.reshape(-1,20))
  model.predict(single_horse)
Error given is :
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-169-ab1c726a3f6f> in <module>()
----> 1 model.predict(single_horse)

    215     if spec.shape is not None:

ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer: expected axis -1 of input shape to have value 21 but received input

What do I need to do?

Thank you for your expertise.  I spent all weekend on trying to get this work.  Actually base of my attempt is copies from a Udemy course
which ran OK.
